2. Setup
Python Installation:
Before running the Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install Python:

1. Windows: Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website and follow the installation instructions.
2. macOS: macOS typically comes with Python pre-installed. You can verify the installation by opening the Terminal and typing python --version. If Python is not installed, you can download the installer from the official Python website.
3. Linux: Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command: sudo apt-get install python3.

**Jupyter Notebook Installation:**
After installing Python, you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook, which is used to run the Python scripts in this repository. Follow these steps to install Jupyter Notebook:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Install Jupyter Notebook using pip, Python's package manager:
pip install notebook



If you prefer using Visual Studio Code for coding and running Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps to set up your environment:

**Install Visual Studio Code from the official website.**
Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. You can find it in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) by searching for 'Python'.
Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
Launch Jupyter Notebooks using the Python extension by selecting a notebook file (.ipynb) and clicking on the 'Run' button at the top right corner of the editor.
You can now access the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser and start exploring the notebooks.

3. Usage
Each notebook in this repository covers a specific topic or machine learning algorithm. To run a notebook:

Open the desired notebook (.ipynb file) in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions and execute the code cells sequentially.
Read the detailed descriptions and explanations provided along with the code.
Feel free to experiment with the code, modify parameters, or try different datasets to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts.


4. Notebooks Overview
